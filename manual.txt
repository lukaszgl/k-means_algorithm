1.Input file format
Variables stored in data file should be separated with spaces and put in following order:
algorithm_iteration_count max_error number_of_classes
point1_atribute_1 point1_atribute_2 ... point1_atribute_n
point2_atribute_1 point2_atribute_2 ... point2_atribute_n
.
.
.
pointm_atribute_1 point2_atribute_2 ... pointm_atribute_n

where:
n is number of atributes(it has to be the same in every point)
m is number of points

2.Input file errors
Data extractrion from file can return following errors:
CAN_NOT_OPEN_FILE -> program is unable to open file, check file path and spelling
HEAD_VARIABLE_VALUE -> unable to convert the top theree variables
HEAD_CLASS_COUNT_TOO_BIG -> number of classes is bigger than number of points
CLASS_ATRIBUTE_VALUE -> unable to convert class atribute
CLASS_ATRIBUTE_COUNT -> point may have a missing or extra atribute

3.Output file format
Output file is written with minimal formating for easier exporting and is formated the following way:

Precision = decimal_precision Error = error
Centroid Cluster_id Point
centroid_atributes cluster_id assigned_point_atributes

4.Output file errors
CAN_NOT_CREATE_FILE -> can not create file, try changing path or check disk health
